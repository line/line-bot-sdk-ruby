## Versioning

The versioning policy for this project follows Semantic Versioning:

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## Breaking changes

The LINE SDK development team has decided to generate codes based on the [LINE OpenAPI](https://github.com/line/line-openapi) specification. As a result, the version 2 series of the LINE Messaging API SDK for Ruby is not compatible with the version 1 series.

We plan to maintain only the version 2 series from now on. The 1 series can still be used, but we recommend using the 2 series to take advantage of the latest features.
